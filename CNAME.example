# Instructions for Custom Domain:
# 1. Rename this file to just "CNAME" (remove .example)
# 2. Replace the domain above with your actual domain
# 3. Configure your DNS settings with your domain provider:
#    - Add a CNAME record pointing to: YOUR-USERNAME.github.io
#    - Or add A records pointing to GitHub's IP addresses:
#      185.199.108.153
#      185.199.109.153
#      185.199.110.153
#      185.199.111.153
# 4. Commit and push the CNAME file to your repository
# 5. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24-48 hours)
